# Synopsis
A small GUI tool for checking the permissions on directories (and files). Reports are saved as .csv.

# Motivation
This project was prompted after the creation of my Active Directory Tool, and functions as a companion to it. The process to manually check the permissions on a directory or file in Windows is tedious, as it involves multiple steps, with no way to easily save the results. This program can quickly get the permissions for a mass number of directories and files, and save the results.

# Building
To build, I advise cloning into Visual Studio 2015.

# License
This project is released under the MIT License.
